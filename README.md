Hi I'm Gergely Kondas, an aspiring self-taught software developer. (19)

I am currently studying software engineering and hope to make a career in back-end development.

My goal is to learn by making, I firmly beleive coding isn't something you can learn without actually doing it.

This github will have a collection of all my personnal projects as well as open source contributions.

I am new to open-source contribution and find the idea fascinating. I beleive open source contribution is a very valuable way of learning as it exposes you
to projects, people and code you would never know about otherwise. Reading and being able to understand code is very important in my opinion but is probably
the hardest skill to gain outside of a business enviroment, open source in my opinion makes up for that by allowing you to also read the code of other people
as you contribute to projects

My experience with technologies include:
∙ Java
∙ Linux OS (Im a linux user only)
∙ Spring
∙ Hibernate
∙ mySQl/ sql scripting
∙ JUnit
∙ Mockito
∙ Spring boot
∙ Git
∙ Javascript & HTML & CSS
∙ C#
∙ Linquer/ Lambda expressions
∙ Entity framework


Technologies I am learning:
∙ Docker
∙ OOP Databses
∙ Linux server deployment and managment
∙ more SQL
∙ Meteor

I am not a master of any of these technologies, just used them to build personal projects as part of learning them, I wish to  improve more outside of University
through personal projects and contributions.
